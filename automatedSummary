Avian flu - which has previously been the subject of pandemic fears after humans began contracting it - is another deadly strain . 

Avian flu is caused by influenza viruses adapted for infection in birds while swine flu is caused by influenza viruses adapted for infection in pigs .

Nicola Sturgeon said the pair who flew back to Scotland on April 21 had not been in an area affected by recent outbreaks of swine influenza . 

US health officials took a similar line , urging visitors to wash their hands frequently . 

These illnesses all cause the same respiratory symptoms in sufferers and can be passed between one another . 

When new influenza viruses are introduced into the environment , humans do not have any natural immunity to protect against them . 

In New York City , health officials say about 75 students at a Queens high school have fallen ill with flu-like symptoms and testing is under way to rule out that is the same strain of swine flu found in Mexico . 

No vaccine specifically protects against swine flu and it is unclear how much protection current generic vaccines might offer . 

Additionally , at least eight students at a New York high school were last night also believed to have a form of human swine flu , but authorities are not yet certain if it is the same strain that has killed people in Mexico . 

As a precautionary measure the patient is being tested for a range of respiratory and other illnesses ... At present there have been no confirmed cases of human swine flu in the UK or anywhere in Europe . ''

The influenza pandemic of 1918 The current swine flu outbreak is of the same strain , H1N1 , as the great flu pandemic of 1918 . 

This has been a transition from old-fashioned pig pens to vast excremental hells , containing tens of thousands of animals with weakened immune systems suffocating in heat and manure while exchanging pathogens at blinding velocity with their fellow inmates . 

The commission reported systemic obstruction of their investigation by corporations , including blatant threats to withhold funding from cooperative researchers . 

Instead of a postcode map , they have a slightly more old-fashioned list of 19 `` community websites '' from Kippax to Calverley but the point and content are much the same .

Making enough for Britain alone could take four to six months , an expert at the Health Protection Agency said . 

One reason is that an earlier swine flu outbreak in the US , in 1976 , found both the political and medical\/public health worlds unprepared to cope with what appeared to be a serious threat of pandemic spread . 

It is clear from the above that public health workers are better prepared to deal with this threat . 

Medicine is also better prepared , since it can distribute the already stockpiled antiviral drugs , and has far better treatments for the pneumonias and other secondary problems that threaten life .

A 12-year-old girl was also among five new cases , prompting the immediate closure of her school in south Gloucestershire . 

At this stage close contacts who should be offered antivirals -LRB- are those -RRB- who have been exposed to a probable or confirmed case within the previous seven days for longer than one hour and within a distance of one metre . '' 

Swine flu is currently being passed from human to human , and it is possible that this particular strain of swine flu was created without ever seeing a pig directly , as UN 's Food and Agriculture Organisation 's -LRB- FAO -RRB- experts on animal health point out . 

The reason experts have invested so much effort in preparing for a flu pandemic and are taking this one so seriously , is that these rapidly evolving strains that mix bird , pig and human forms could throw up a particularly deadly variety . 

Health experts have warned for years about the danger of intensive livestock farming creating new and rampant human disease . 

`` Deciding to give priority for a new vaccine will be a judgment call , based on evidence we are now gathering about the swine flu virus 's behavior , '' said Professor David Salisbury , head of immunisation at the Department of Health . 

`` We have injected viruses into hen 's eggs , where they will grow for two or three days before being extracted , '' said Dr James Robertson , a virologist . 

`` Only about 20 % take up offers of immunisation , compared with the elderly , who have a 70 to 75 % uptake . 

We are going to need to have all our doctors , nurses , ambulance drivers and other carers at work if there is a second serious outbreak later in the year and not at home in bed , sick . 

The number of cases has been small but no one yet knows how far the H1N1 virus will spread , how it will mutate and how many people will be caught up in this first wave of infection . 

Previous pandemics have behaved in this way , such as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic , with a second or third wave returning months later to infect many more people than the milder first wave . 

But late yesterday the health minister , Jose Angel Cordova , dented optimism by saying 11 people were suspected to have died within 24 hours . 

It is important to make this clear because -LRB- otherwise -RRB- when we announce level six it will cause unnecessary panic , '' she told Spain 's El Pa s newspaper . 

Having just finished a TV series that spent most of its time debunking news broadcasts , I 've been swamped with emails and Tweets saying , `` Ha ha - the news is really overdoing it on this whole swine flu thing , eh ? '' 

Sars and bird flu may have failed -LRB- so far -RRB- to become pandemics , but only because health professionals took the threat seriously . 

The school has arranged for all pupils and staff to be offered antiviral treatment tonight or tomorrow morning . 

Yesterday health officials announced that South Hampstead high school would be closed until Thursday on advice from the HPA . 

Other options include looking at how pupils can sit exams in isolation even if a school is closed . 

Only those who have been working within one metre of the affected person for an hour or more are considered sufficiently at risk to be given antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu , which can prevent them falling sick . 

Five schools shut because of swine flu GCSE and A-level exams rescheduled as schools in London and south-west close to prevent virus spread Tuesday 5 May 2009 14.37 BST Governors at Dolphin school in Battersea decided to shut its doors as a precaution after two of its pupils were confirmed with the virus . 

Alleyn 's school in Dulwich , south-east London , closed when six pupils were confirmed with having the H1N1 virus yesterday .

Scottish officials were investigating another probable case involving a 21-year-old woman from Grampian who recently traveled to New York . 

Zoo animal placed in quarantine over swine flu fears Wednesday 6 May 2009 15.16 BST It was lonely enough anyway , being the only pig in one of the world 's most devoutly Muslim countries . 

While there is speculation that the new strain of the H1N1 virus could have originated on industrial pig farms before spreading to humans , there would appear to be little risk from a solitary pig , particularly in a country with no direct flight connections with Mexico , where the majority of the 1,000 or so worldwide swine flu cases have been identified so far . 

Lonely though Kabul zoo 's pig might be , it has actually escaped lightly by the standards of its peers in some other countries . 

Basing final results on other evidence , like coursework or modules already completed -LRB- also known as special consideration -RRB- , is just one contingency arrangement , and would only happen in specific circumstances where a student was unable to take a particular exam .

Swine flu could affect third of world 's population , says study Researchers say swine flu will spread around world within nine months , as UK confirms three more cases Tuesday 12 May 2009 16.36 BST The swine flu virus will infect a third of the world 's population if it continues to spread at its current rate , scientists warned today , as three more cases were confirmed in the UK . 

But it is still possible it could be -LRB- like -RRB- 1957 where about three to four out of 1,000 people who were infected died and overall about 3 million to 4 million people died that year because of the pandemic worldwide or it could be even milder than that , like the 1968 pandemic which was barely worse than a normal seasonal flu year . 

`` One of the key decisions which has to be made this week by the world community is how much do we switch over current vaccine production for seasonal flu to make a vaccine against this particular virus . ''

The WHO chief , Dr Margaret Chan , yesterday examined data from eight countries with large numbers of swine flu cases . 

Raising the alert level reflects that the virus is more widespread , but not necessarily more dangerous although there are fears that infections could overwhelm hospitals and health authorities , especially in poorer countries . 

Most cases have been mild , although employers are being warned to prepare for absences through illness . 

One manufacturer , GlaxoSmithKline PLC , said it could start large-scale production by July but large quantities would not be available for several months . 

At the NHS Confederation conference , senior health service managers held an early-morning session to refine their emergency plans . 

So far , however , there has been only a handful of cases to report , and these people appear to have suffered little more than a bad cold , leaving the public -LRB- and even some journalists -RRB- slightly baffled at what all the fuss is about or even if we should be making a fuss at all . 

It is also important to remember that we are extremely lucky that the type of flu we are now facing , Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , is a less deadly strain than might have mutated from the H5N1 bird flu many scientists expected . 

With 1,300 cases now being reported in Australia , and simultaneous community outbreaks in Chile , Japan and the United States , Chan said scientists had concluded that transmission was `` unstoppable '' hence the decision to declare a maximum pandemic alert at level six . 

In 2007 , the latest year for which figures are available , Aids-related illness killed 2 million people worldwide , including 270,000 children . 

But because two-thirds of the 33 million people annually infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa and the remainder belong , by and large , to discrete `` high-risk '' groups such as intravenous drug users , HIV no longer blips on our radar screens . 

Or as a taxi driver in York put it en route to York University 's biology department where scientists are currently breeding high-yielding strains of Artemisia Annua , the plant from which artemisinin is derived , to produce sufficient quantities of the drug for Cambodia `` Unless it affects someone in my family , why should I care ? '' 

Are we again set to face a disease that can kill millions as happened with the pandemics of 1918 , 1957 and 1968 ? 

The latter disease is difficult to acquire but is highly virulent if caught .

However , Sir Liam Donaldson , the chief medical officer for England and Wales , said the virus was causing very few illnesses compared with normal seasonal flu viruses , although a `` large surge '' in numbers was likely this autumn .
